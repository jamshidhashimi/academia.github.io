	<h2> 2010 Presidential Tracking Polls (First Round, <i>1ยบ Turno</i>)
<p>The field was far thinner than in 1989 or today. The PSDB-PT alternation hegemony was still in tact (with the PMDB quid-pro-quo-ing its way into the VP slot). When he left office, Lula's popularity ratings were the highest of any world leader ever recorded at 87 percent (with an also-astronomical 80 percent of respondents approving of his government).</p>

<p>Serra and Dilma's tracking polls diverged at a late-June inflection point, right after the party nominating conventions. On June 13, 2010, PT delegates held a pro forma vote to officialize Dilma as their candidate (and Temer as her vice-president, a nod to how effectively the PMDB had quietly consolidated political power in the preceding years). At the nominating convention, Dilma said that she would "continue Lula's Brazil" but "with the heart and soul of a woman." After that, the campaigns ramped up, and Lula appeared on TV and at rallies nearly every day on behalf of Dilma. The race was never close after that; Dilma narrowly missed winning in the first round (by 3 percentage points), and she/Lula beat Serra by 12 million votes (12.1 percentage points) in the runoff.</p>
