	<h1> History </h1>
	<p>How quickly we forget. Here are some comparative visualizations from previous electoral cycles' tracking polls.</p>

	<h2> 2010 Presidential Tracking Polls (<i>1ยบ Turno</i>, First Round) </h2>
	<p> The field was far thinner than in 1989 or today. The PSDB-PT alternation hegemony was still in tact (with the PMDB quid-pro-quo-ing its way into the VP slot). When he left office, Lula's popularity ratings were the highest of any world leader ever recorded at <a href="http://g1.globo.com/politica/noticia/2010/12/popularidade-de-lula-bate-recorde-e-chega-87-diz-ibope.html">87 percent</a> (with an also-astronomical 80 percent of respondents approving of his government).</p>

<p>Serra and Dilma's tracking polls diverged at a late-June inflection point, right after the party nominating conventions. On June 13, 2010, PT delegates held a pro forma vote to officialize Dilma as their candidate (and Temer as her vice-president, a nod to how effectively the PMDB had quietly consolidated political power in the preceding years). At the nominating convention, Dilma <a href="http://g1.globo.com/especiais/eleicoes-2010/noticia/2010/06/dilma-rousseff-e-oficializada-como-candidata-do-pt-presidencia.html">said</a> that she would "continue Lula's Brazil" but "with the heart and soul of a woman." After that, the campaigns ramped up, and Lula appeared on TV and at rallies nearly every day on behalf of Dilma. The race was never close after that; Dilma narrowly missed winning in the first round (by 3 percentage points), and she/Lula beat Serra by 12 million votes (12.1 percentage points) in the runoff.
