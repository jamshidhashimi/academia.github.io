<h3><b>The Boycott That Never Was: Political Capitalism and the Targets of Contention</b></h3>
<p>Why do citizens repeatedly sanction certain targets, while other known-culprits escape reproach? To answer this question, I'm working with <a href="https://www.paolaometto.com/">Paola Ometto</a> (California State University, San Marcos) and Luiz Flávio Ferrante on a multi-method study that consists of in-depth interviews, comparative historical research, natural language processing, and text mining to build a database of over 10,000 contentious political actions (and their targets) spanning three decades in Brazil.</p>

<p><h3><b>Revolt of the Peripheries: Shifting Electoral Geographies in Brazil</b></h3></p>
<p><a href="http://www.lse.ac.uk/lacc/people/research-staff/Matthew-Richmond">Matthew Aaron Richmond</a> (London School of Economics, UNESP) and I are investigating Bolsonaro’s authoritarian neoliberal electoral coalition using microdata from Brazil's electoral court and geospatial development indicators from the <a href="<a href="">Human Development Atlas</a>. We observe the blurring of class divisions both over time and across parties in four of Brazil's largest metro areas: São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Belo Horizonte, and Porto Alegre. We presented preliminary findings at the 2019 Royal Geographical Society annual conference.
