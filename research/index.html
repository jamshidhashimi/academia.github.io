<h3><b>The Boycott that Never Was</b></h3>
<p>Why do citizens repeatedly sanction certain targets, while other known-culprits escape reproach? To answer this question, I'm working with Maria Paola Ometto (University of Alberta; Fundação Getúlio Vargas) and Luiz Flávio Ferrante on a multi-method study that consists of in-depth interviews, comparative historical research, natural language processing and text mining to build a database of over 20,000 contentious political actions spanning three decades in Brazil.</p>
