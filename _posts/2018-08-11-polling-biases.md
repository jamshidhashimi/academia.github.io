<p> Here's some longitudinal trends in Lula's polling disaggregated by the company/institute that conducted the research. As expected, Vox consistently reports the highest levels of support, though thte trend line matches that of Datafolha. Its' somewhat surprising that Parana's trendline is upward, but that may be due to sparseness of data. As in the aggregate polling for all candidates, Lula's polling increased dramatically after he was first detained for questioning on March 4, 2016, and leveled off and/or tends downward after the January 2018 "conviction" and his jailing on April 7, 2018. </p>
