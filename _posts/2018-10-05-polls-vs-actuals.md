<h2> Historically, did voters break left or right at the end of the campaign?</h2>

<p> The race couldn't be closer and the stakes couldn't be higher. 147 million voters go to the polls this Sunday, Oct. 7, to vote for. That's 10 million more voters than turned out in the U.S.' 2016 general election. Bolsonaro's upward trend in the past week has his supporters convinced that he will win the necessary 50 percent (plus one) in the first round, while loyal petistas say that it's a stastical impossibility. </p>
<p> I looked at the polling trends since democratization and compared it with the final vote tally. Since Datafolha and Ibope are the most reputable institutions (and since they are the only ones to have a long enough track record), I averaged the two to estimate the final, best guess of the pollsters before Brazilians went to the polls. The results are below.
<p> Below is a graph that indicates overperformance of the polls shaded in green and underperformance in red. The highest variance was in the last election, 2014, when Aécio overperformed the poll that was released the day before election by nearly 10 points (9.6pp). The second highest was also PSDB, in 2006, when Alckmin seemingly jumped 8 points between the time the last poll was conducted and when ballots were cast. The third highest overperformer was Enéas of PRONA, the nationalist party holdover from the dictatorship, in 1994, when his poll numbers weren't even reported by Datafolha but he won more than 7 percent of the vote. Fourth highest was FHC in the same year, when he outperfomed his polls by 6.2 points to win in the first round.
<p> Elections are rare events. We can't infer anything with confidence with only seven observations. We can say, however, that since 1989, no right or center-right candidate has underperformed their final poll numbers in the first round of voting.
