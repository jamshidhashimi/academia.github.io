<h2> PSOL's Endorsement Primary </h2>

<p> This Monday, March 5, Guilherme Boulos of the MTST formally registered as an affiliate of Brazil's socialist party, PSOL. His acclamation counted on none other than Lula's support of his increasingly likely candidacy (in the face of Lula's increasingly unlikely one). PSOL's electoral college meets on the 10th, and Boulos is almost certainly going to be anointed the party's official pre-candidate.<p>

<p> But, as anyone who has read Sabrina Fernandes' <a href="http://www.ihu.unisinos.br/159-noticias/entrevistas/569025-a-fragmentacao-da-esquerda-a-crise-da-praxis-e-a-melancolia-entrevista-especial-com-sabrina-fernandes">brilliant work</a> on the fragemented and "melancholic" Brazilian Left might surmise, Boulos is not the consensus candidate among the 40+ internal tendencies of the party.

<p> I spent this afternoon scraping the party's five <a href="http://www.psol50.org.br/pre-candidaturas-a-presidencia/">pre-candidate statements</a>, which include a list of their endrosements segmented by role. Below is a network map of what I found (each grey node represents 100 grassroots supporter signatures in support of a candidacy):
