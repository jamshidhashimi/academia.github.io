<h2> PSOL's Endorsement Primary </h2>

<p> This Monday, March 5, Guilherme Boulos of the MTST formally registered as an affiliate of Brazil's socialist party, PSOL. His acclamation counted on none other than Lula's support of his increasingly likely candidacy (in the face of Lula's increasingly unlikely one). PSOL's electoral college meets on the 10th, and Boulos is almost certainly going to be anointed the party's official pre-candidate.<p>

<p> But, as anyone who has read Sabrina Fernandes' <a href="http://www.ihu.unisinos.br/159-noticias/entrevistas/569025-a-fragmentacao-da-esquerda-a-crise-da-praxis-e-a-melancolia-entrevista-especial-com-sabrina-fernandes">brilliant work</a> on the fragemented and "melancholic" Brazilian Left might have guessed, Boulos is not the consensus candidate among the 40+ internal tendencies of the party. In fact, some of the party's heavyweights are downright pissed. Babá, the founder of PSOL, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/babapsol/">said</a> that "a Lulist candidacy is an affront to our history" [the party cleaved off from the PT during Lula's first term]. During tonight's debate, another pre-candidate, Plínio Jr., said, "Boulos is welcome to our party, but not under Lula's thumb."
 
<p> I wanted to see what, if any, patterns might underlie these <i>rachas internas</i> and the articulation processes that result, so I spent this afternoon scraping the party's five <a href="http://www.psol50.org.br/pre-candidaturas-a-presidencia/">pre-candidate statements</a>. Below is a network map of the endorsements embedded in the candidate's platforms:
<p>

<p> Each grey node represents 100 grassroots supporter signatures in support of a candidacy. (Boulos had appx. 9,062 while the second-highest grassroots signature gatherer was Sônia, with just over 2,000.)<p> 
 
<p> What's most interesting to me about this is the ratio of grassroots supporters to party leaders and party intellectuals. Plínio Jr. (whose dad ran in 2010) has almost twice as many party leaders and intellectual endorsements as does Boulos (23 vs. 12). But those endorsements did not seem to translate into a groundswell of grassroots support. The critique of Boulos is that he was smuggled in as a "satellite candidacy," bypassing the party structure. But he has a base—and not just any base, one that is organized and committed. Anyone who has been studying the MTST/Boulos qualitatively over the past few years will tell you that the base preceeded the higher-profile political endorsements from PSOL's six congressional reps. An organized grassroots base is a form of political currency. Ideological purism...less so.<p>
