	<p> <h1> Liz McKenna </h1> </p>
<p> I am a Ph.D. candidate in sociology at the University of California, Berkeley. Starting in the fall of 2019, I will begin a post-doc at the <a href="https://snfagora.jhu.edu/">SNF Agora Institute</a> at Johns Hopkins University. I use mixed methods (ethnography, interviews, big data, and network analysis) to study the relationship between disruptive and routine politics. My research agenda broadly asks: When do civil society organizations safeguard against authoritarianism, and when do they become the primary carriers of it?</p>

<p>For my dissertation, I asked this question in the context of contemporary Brazil. (Some of my blog posts on this website reflect some of the prospective parts of the case study.) In this book manuscript in process, titled <i>The Revolution Will Be Organized: Power and Protest in Brazil’s New Republic, 1988-2018</i>, I show that power struggles among meso-level actors—specific capital fractions, political parties, and Pentecostal church networks (which I argue constitute the most powerful social movement in Brazil)—best explain how and why the political terrain shifted so dramatically in what was once the largest social democracy in the Americas.</p>

<p>With my co-authors Hahrie Han and Michelle Oyakawa, our forthcoming book <i>Of, By, For: The Political Logic of Collective Action</i> (under advance contract, University of Chicago Press) develops a theory of what we call strategic self-governance based on a multi-year, six state case study of grassroots organizations in the United States. My first book, <a href="https://global.oup.com/academic/product/groundbreakers-9780199394609?cc=us&lang=en&"><i>Groundbreakers: How Obama’s 2.2 Million Volunteers Transformed Campaigning in America</i></a> (co-authored with Oxford University Press, 2014) analyzed how the Obama campaign turned a social movement into an electoral machine. Before grad school, I worked as a political and community organizer in Ohio and Rio de Janeiro and obtained a B.A. in social studies from Harvard.</p>
