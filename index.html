<p> I am a post-doc at the <a href="https://snfagora.jhu.edu/">SNF Agora Institute</a> at Johns Hopkins University and P3 Lab. I received my Ph.D. in sociology from the University of California, Berkeley. I use multiple methods (ethnographic, interview, spatial, and network analysis) to study organizations, power, and political change. My current research program examines how civil society can both enable and constrain democracy.</p>

<p>My dissertation, which received the 2021 <a href="https://www.asanet.org/about/awards/dissertation-award">American Sociological Association Dissertation Award</a>, investigates this question in the context of contemporary Brazil. Titled <i>The Revolution Will Be Organized: Power and Protest in Brazil’s New Republic, 1988-2018</i>, I show how the organizational dynamics of civil society affect the rise and fall of democratic regimes. I argue that even in an age of diffuse media, atomized protest, and hollowed out party systems, the political labor of group-making that happens inside organizations can critically affect the conditions that give rise to (or protect against) illiberal politics.</p>

<p>In a separate project with <a href="http://www.hahriehan.com">Hahrie Han</a> and <a href="https://mobilizingideas.wordpress.com/michelle-oyakawa/">Michelle Oyakawa</a>, our book <i><a href="https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/P/bo68659118.html">Prisms of the People: Power and Organizing in 21st Century America</a></i> (University of Chicago Press, 2021) draws on a multi-year, multi-method, six state study of grassroots organizations that won significant victories. We examine how organizational leaders build constituency bases with the kinds of characteristics that enable the collective and strategic exercise of political power. My first book, <a href="https://global.oup.com/academic/product/groundbreakers-9780199394609?cc=us&lang=en&"><i>Groundbreakers: How Obama’s 2.2 Million Volunteers Transformed Campaigning in America</i></a> (Oxford University Press, co-authored with Hahrie Han) analyzed how the Obama campaign turned a social movement into an electoral machine. We identify how parties and campaigns interact with—and sometimes act as—social movements. Before grad school, I worked as a political and community organizer in Ohio and Rio de Janeiro and earned a B.A. in social studies from Harvard.</p>
